        Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an enigmatic condition characterized by fatigue
        that is unaided by rest and by exacerbation of symptoms after exertion (post-exertional
        malaise or &amp;ldquo;PEM&amp;rdquo;). There is no definitive molecular marker
        or known underlying pathological mechanism for the condition. Increasing evidence
        for aberrant energy metabolism suggests a role for mitochondrial dysfunction
        in ME/CFS. Our objective was therefore to measure mitochondrial function and
        cellular stress sensing in actively metabolising patient blood cells. We immortalized
        lymphoblasts isolated from 51 ME/CFS patients diagnosed according to the Canadian
        Consensus Criteria and an age- and gender-matched control group. Parameters
        of mitochondrial function and energy stress sensing were assessed by Seahorse
        extracellular flux analysis, proteomics, and an array of additional biochemical
        assays. As a proportion of the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), the rate
        of ATP synthesis by Complex V was significantly reduced in ME/CFS lymphoblasts,
        while significant elevations were observed in Complex I OCR, maximum OCR,
        spare respiratory capacity, nonmitochondrial OCR and &amp;ldquo;proton leak&amp;rdquo;
        as a proportion of the basal OCR. This was accompanied by an elevation of
        mitochondrial membrane potential, chronically hyperactivated TOR Complex I
        stress signalling and upregulated expression of mitochondrial respiratory
        complexes, fatty acid transporters and enzymes of the &amp;beta;-oxidation
        and TCA cycles. By contrast, mitochondrial mass and genome copy number, as
        well as glycolytic rates and steady state ATP levels were unchanged. Our results
        suggest a model in which ME/CFS lymphoblasts have a Complex V defect accompanied
        by compensatory upregulation of their respiratory capacity that includes the
        mitochondrial respiratory complexes, membrane transporters and enzymes involved
        in fatty acid &amp;beta;-oxidation. This homeostatically returns ATP synthesis
        and steady state levels to &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; in resting cells,
        but may leave them unable to adequately respond to acute increases in energy
        demand as the relevant homeostatic pathways are already activated.</p>\r\n
